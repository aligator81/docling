## üö® Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. Database Query Errors - **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Problem**: SQLAlchemy query failures when deleting documents with joins
```python
# ERROR in backend/app/routers/documents.py:142
sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: Can't call Query.update() or Query.delete() when join(), outerjoin(), select_from(), or from_self() has been called
```

**Immediate Fix**:
```python
# Replace problematic join-based delete with subquery approach
chunk_ids = db.query(DocumentChunk.id).filter(
    DocumentChunk.document_id == document_id
).subquery()

deleted_embeddings = db.query(Embedding).filter(
    Embedding.chunk_id.in_(chunk_ids)
).delete(synchronize_session=False)
```

### 2. Synchronous Processing Blocking - **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Problem**: Document processing blocks API responses, poor user experience

**Solution**: Implement Celery for background task processing with Redis broker

### 3. Security Vulnerabilities - **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Problem**: Limited file content validation, no rate limiting, potential for malicious uploads

**Solution**: Implement comprehensive security measures including file scanning, rate limiting, and enhanced validation
