Players: Any number from 2 to 12 that is divisible by 2 or 3 can play ( $2,3,4,6,8,9,10$ or 12). Up to 3 may play individually. More than 3 must be in teams. No more than 3 teams can play.\n\n## GAME FOR 2 PLAYERS OR 2 TEAMS\n\n## Object of the game\n\nOne player or team must score TWO SEQUENCES before their opponents.\nA Sequence is a connected series of five of the same color marker chip in a straight line, either up and down, across or diagonally on the playing surface.\n\n## Preparation\n\nChoose two colors of chips. Keep the third color away from the game board.\nTeam players must be evenly divided into two teams. Team members must alternate their physical positions with opponents around the playing surface.\nPlayers cut cards and lowest card deals - Aces are high.\nThe dealer should shuffle the cards and deal out the same number of cards to each player (see table below for proper number of cards to be dealt). The remaining cards are laid down as draw deck, facing down. The players now pick up their cards making sure no one see them.\nPlace the game board on a flat surface with enough room around the game board for placement of the draw deck of cards, marker chips and discards for each player.\n\n## Number of cards dealt each player\n\n2 players - 7 cards each 8 players - 4 cards each\n4 players - 6 cards each 10 players - 3 cards each\n6 players - 5 cards each 12 players - 3 cards each\n\n## How you play the game\n\nBegin with the player to the left of the dealer and move in a clockwise direction.\n\n## Your turn\n\nYou select a card of your choice from your hand and place it face up on a discard pile (players should start their own discard pile in front of them visible to all other players).\nThen place one of your marker chips on the matching card on the game board.\nFinally, you draw a new card from the draw deck.\nBe careful! Once you have taken your turn and placed your marker chip on the game board, you must take a card from the draw deck. It you fail to take a card before the next player makes a move AND takes his/her card, you lose the right to take a card and you must finish the game with less cards than the other players a disadvantage.\n\nThe game board. Each card is pictured twice on the game board, with the exception of the Jacks (see below). A player can play on either one of the card spaces as long as it is not already covered by another marker chip.\n\nBonus chips. The printed chips in the four corners of the game board are Bonus chips. All players must use them as though their color marker chip is in the corner. When using a corner, only four of your marker chips are needed to complete a Sequence. More than one player may use the same corner as part of a Sequence.\nThese two teams are busy building a Sequence; one team a vertical Sequence, the other team horizontal. The teams can easily share the Bonus chip in the corner and thereby both count it as a part of their Sequence.\n\nThe Jacks. There are 8 Jacks in the card deck, some with two eyes, other with one-eye.\nThe Jacks with TWO EYES are wild. To play a two-eyed Jack, place it on your discard pile and place one of your marker chips on any open space on the game board.\n\nThe Jacks with ONE EYE are anti-wild. To play a one-eyed Jack, place it on your discard pile and remove one marker chip from the game board belonging to your opponent. That completes your turn. You cannot place one of your marker chips on that same space during this turn. You cannot remove a marker chip that is already part of a completed SEQUENCE. Once a SEQUENCE is achieved by a player or a team, it cannot be broken.\nYou may play either one of the Jacks whenever they work best for your strategy, during your turn.\nDead Card. If you hold a card in your hand which does not have an open space on the game board because both spaces representing that card are covered by a marker chip, you are holding a DEAD CARD and you may turn it in for a new card. When it is your turn, place the dead card on your discard pile, announce that you are turning in a Dead Card and take a replacement card (one card per turn). You then proceed to play your normal turn.\n\n# To win the game \n\nThe first player or team that scores two Sequences wins the game. Please note that you may use any one of the spaces from your first Sequence as part of you second.\n\nAlternative rule. There must be no table talk or coaching team members. If a teammate says anything that alerts a fellow teammate to the fact that they are about to do something that they shouldn't, every member of that team must forfeit one card of their choice from their hand placing it on their discard pile.\n\nAdvanced rule. In this version of the game you can remove your opponents marker chip, even though it is already part of a completed Sequence.\n\n## GAME FOR 3 PLAYERS OR 3 TEAMS\n\nThe game is played in the same manner as with 2 players or 2 teams, except for the following:\n\n## Object of the game\n\nOne player or team must score ONE SEQUENCE before their opponents.\nTeam players must divide evenly into three teams. Team members must alternate their physical positions every third player around the playing surface.\n\n## Number of cards dealt each player\n\nFor 3 players - 6 cards each For 9 players - 4 cards each\nFor 6 players - 5 cards each For 12 players - 3 cards each\n\n## To win the game\n\nThe first player or team that scores one Sequence wins the game!\n\n",
