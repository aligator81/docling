# ⏱️ Long Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Is 1+ Hour Deployment Normal?

**Short answer: No, this is NOT normal.** A typical deployment should take 10-20 minutes maximum.

## 🚨 Why Your Deployment is Taking Too Long

### Common Causes of Long Deployments:

**1. Large Dependencies (Most Likely Cause)**
- Your `requirements.txt` includes heavy ML libraries:
  - `torch` (~2GB)
  - `torchvision` (~1GB)
  - `transformers` (~1GB)
  - `opencv-python-headless` (~200MB)
  - CUDA libraries for GPU support

**2. Slow Server/Network Issues**
- Low-end VPS with limited CPU/RAM
- Slow internet connection on server
- GitHub rate limiting during package downloads

**3. Build Process Stuck**
- Dependency conflicts
- Memory issues during compilation
- Docker build hanging

## 🔧 Immediate Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Check Coolify Logs
Look for these patterns in the deployment logs:

**If stuck on specific package:**
```
# Stuck on torch installation
Building wheels for collected packages: torch
```

**If memory issues:**
```
Killed - process terminated due to memory
```

**If network issues:**
```
Connection reset by peer
Read timeout
```

### Step 2: Check Server Resources
**In Coolify Dashboard:**
- Monitor CPU/Memory usage during build
- Check if resources are maxed out

### Step 3: Optimize Your Dependencies

**Create a lighter `requirements.txt` for deployment:**
```txt
# Core dependencies only
streamlit==1.28.0
openai==1.3.0
mistralai==0.1.2
python-dotenv==1.0.0
requests==2.31.0
numpy==1.24.0
scikit-learn==1.3.0
pymupdf==1.23.0
pillow==10.0.0
psycopg2-binary==2.9.7
docling==1.2.0
tiktoken==0.5.0
```

**Remove heavy dependencies temporarily:**
- Comment out `torch`, `torchvision`, `transformers`
- Remove CUDA libraries if not using GPU

## 🚀 Quick Fix Solutions

### Solution 1: Cancel and Restart Deployment
1. **Cancel current deployment** in Coolify
2. **Optimize requirements.txt** (use lighter version above)
3. **Commit changes** and redeploy

### Solution 2: Use Pre-built Docker Image
1. **Build locally** on a faster machine
2. **Push to Docker Hub**
3. **Configure Coolify** to use pre-built image

### Solution 3: Increase Server Resources
- Upgrade to a VPS with more RAM (4GB+ recommended)
- Ensure adequate disk space (20GB+)

## 📊 Expected Timelines

**Normal Deployment:**
- Dependency download: 5-10 minutes
- Package installation: 5-10 minutes
- Container startup: 1-2 minutes
- **Total: 10-20 minutes**

**Your Current Situation (1+ hour):**
- Indicates serious bottleneck
- Likely memory or network issues
- Requires immediate intervention

## 🔍 Diagnostic Commands (If You Have Server Access)

**Check server resources:**
```bash
# Check memory usage
free -h

# Check disk space
df -h

# Check running processes
htop
```

**Check Docker status:**
```bash
# Check Docker containers
docker ps -a

# Check Docker logs
docker logs [container-name]

# Check Docker system resources
docker system df
```

## 🎯 Immediate Action Plan

1. **Cancel the current deployment** in Coolify dashboard
2. **Create optimized requirements.txt** (use lighter version)
3. **Commit and push changes**
4. **Redeploy with optimized dependencies**
5. **Monitor the new deployment closely**

## ⚠️ Warning Signs

**If you see these in logs, cancel immediately:**
- Repeated "Killed" messages (memory issues)
- "Connection reset" errors (network issues)
- Same package installing for >10 minutes (stuck)

## 💡 Prevention for Future Deployments

**Optimize Your Dependencies:**
- Use specific versions, not latest
- Remove unused packages
- Consider lighter alternatives
- Use CPU-only versions of ML libraries

**Server Recommendations:**
- Minimum: 2GB RAM, 2 vCPUs
- Recommended: 4GB RAM, 4 vCPUs
- Fast internet connection required

Your deployment should not take more than 20-30 minutes maximum. The current 1+ hour indicates a serious issue that needs immediate attention.
