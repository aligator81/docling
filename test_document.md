# Test Document for Extraction

This is a test document to verify that the document extraction functionality is working correctly after fixing the Docling configuration issue.

## Features to Test

- Text extraction from markdown files
- Proper handling of headers and formatting
- Content length calculation
- Processing time measurement

## Sample Content

This document contains various markdown elements including:

1. Headers (H1, H2)
2. Lists (ordered and unordered)
3. Code blocks
4. Bold and italic text

The extraction should preserve the structure and content of the document while converting it to plain text format.
